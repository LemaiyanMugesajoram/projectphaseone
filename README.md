# Aviation Risk Analysis – Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 60 years of civil aviation accident data (1962–2023) from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to help identify the safest aircraft for commercial and private operations.

The goal is to support evidence-based decisions for aircraft acquisition by evaluating manufacturers and models based on accident frequency, injury severity, and survivability trends.

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk and low-risk aircraft manufacturers using historical incident data.
- Compare safety performance across different aircraft models.
- Highlight key accident patterns by phase of flight.
- Provide business recommendations for safer aircraft selection and operations.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau
- PowerPoint

## Key Insights
- Riskiest manufacturers: CESSNA, PIPER, BOEING
- Safest manufacturers: UNIVERSAL STINSON, MONNETT, AEROPRO CZ
- Top safe models: Boeing 737, Cessna 206B
- Cruise and approach phases had the highest number of fatalities
